    <p style="font-family: 'Orbitron', sans-serif;">
      As a website developer of over 10+ years, this will be the first full website Odin has built with VueJS.<br/>
      Other websites designed & developed had been utilizing Ruby on Rails or PHP.<br/>
      <br/>
      Odin, the son of no man (Officially), has catered his entire life to living up to families expectations and seeking<br/>
      approval. After failing, and realizing some of the issues wrong with the past, Odin decided to start fresh.<br/>
      Carrying only over his knowledge of programming, he removed several friends from his life, removed all but 2 family members,<br/>
      and is moving forward with a new light in the world! <br/>
